### What I learned

The elements you want to manipulate separately from other elements should be wrapped in their own div.

```html
<div class="qr-text">
    <h1 class="qr-title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <p class="qr-description">
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your code skills to
        the next level
    </p>
</div>
```

### Useful resources

-   [Type scale](https://www.type-scale.com) - This helped me for choosing font sizes easily.
-   [CSS box-shadow generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - A great website for generating box-shadow instead of guessing value over and over again.
